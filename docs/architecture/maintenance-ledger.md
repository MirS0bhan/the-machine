## Next suggested work

Rotate when completing a row. Prefer top item not in cooldown.

1. **G13** — merge #147 (GRUB template CI) or operator hardware smoke on physical target
2. **G17** — compositor: wlroots seat/output + `wl_compositor` global (cooldown until 2026-09-06)
3. **audit** — missing integration test for an MCP method in component-inventory.yaml
4. **audit** — `make verify` + fix first failure
